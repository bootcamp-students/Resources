# Vue Switchable Grid

Toggle display between list and grid view using Vue.

## Desired Behavior

1. On initial page load, the grid view (large images) should be displayed.
2. The user can switch between list (small images) and grid view using icons
in the upper right of the navigation bar.
3. When in list view, the list view icon should be highlighted and the grid
view icon should not.
4. When in grid view, the grid view icon should be highlighted and the list
view icon should not.
5. The application should not reload the entire page; use Vue features to 
show/hide content.

## Stretch Goals

1. Restyle this example using Bootstrap.
2. Add instant search to filter results.
3. Add a form that allows users to fetch an arbitrary number of cat images
rather than the default 6.
4. Fetch data from a different API - specifically one that returns data in 
JSON format and has more metadata.
