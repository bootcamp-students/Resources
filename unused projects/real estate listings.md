# Real Estate Listings

Create a webpage that displays real estate listings.

## Objectives and requirements

To complete the assignment, you must:

1. Create a public repo in your personal GitHub account.
2. Create HTML, JS, and markdown files and add them to your project.
3. Push your code to GitHub.
4. Deploy your application to Heroku.

Bootstrap 3 or 4 should be used for basic styling. Do not spend time customizing the CSS; use only Bootstrap classes.

Your code should store the property data in JavaScript variables and loop through those results to build your listings page.

Your listings should group properties by type and display them in different sections. 

## Data

Your real estate listings will have 3 types of properties:
    1. Single-family homes
    2. Multi-family homes
    3. Commercial properties

Use the data supplied in properties.js for this assignment.
    
## Application file structure

Minimally:

  app/
    index.html - menu page
    main.js - JavaScript code
  docs/
    requirements.md
  README.md
  Procfile
  package.json

Make sure there's something to read in your README file.

It's okay if your project has more files, but at the least you need the ones listed above.

## Remember to push to GitHub!

Your repo should be public so that others can see your code and comment on it.

## Remember to deploy to Heroku!

You will need to follow our example boilerplate to set up an Express server.

You will also need to include a Procfile so Heroku knows how to start your server.

## If you finish early...

Add interactivity! Here are a few suggestions (but feel free to come up with your own ideas):

* Create a navigation menu with three items: "Single-Family", "Multi-Family", and "Commercial". When users click an item, highlight it and display that category's listings.

* Display only address and asking price on initial page load. Click an icon next to the address to display description and features.

## If you get stuck...

Ask. :smile:
